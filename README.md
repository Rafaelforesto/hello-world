# hello-world
Hello guys, my name is Rafael, I am an MBA student at INSEAD and I have a project to create a bar recommender. I currently own an instagram page in Brazil called PartiuBar which recommends bars to its followers and my idea is to automate this process though data science. Even though I understand a lot of business and statistics, I have very poor programing skills and I have been stuck in the coding for some time. I would like help to create an algorithim that will ask questions to the user and return a bar / restaurant that most closely matches its preferences (asked). This is a combination of Akinator.com (an online version of the 20 questions game) with trip advisor. We currently have a base with 300 points, around 15 parameters. My initial idea would be to make a overfited decision tree which would show what are the best questions to ask (parameters). Thanks
